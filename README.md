## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

   I used the provided link to help with creating the random sequence as seen in my getRandomIntInclusive function.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    Using and adapting to new programming languages was definitely the trickiest thing about this project. At my univeristy, CSUF, we are taught to code in C++, and other languages are just optional. Javascript was the closest thing syntaxically to C++ so I didn't find it too difficult to know what I was doing, but the HTML and CSS are so interesting to me. My knowledge of front end development is not great, and it's something that I am going to put in work to understand more because it was so fun to make this project. I overcame this difficulty by using the information given to me in the steps of this project, and that really gave me everything I needed to succeed.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    My questions would include: Is it possible to use code other than Javascript to make things work? Would I be able to use C++ or would it take a lot more implementation? What are the limitations of front end dev? What can it do that other languages can't?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    If I had more hours to work on this project I would definitely create more buttons and make the game faster. I would also make the buttons unclickable while the seequence is playing, as that is an easy way to just win without having to remember it. I would also make a home screen where you would be able to pick from a variety of other games.
